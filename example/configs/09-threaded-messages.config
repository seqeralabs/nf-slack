/*
 * Example 09: Threaded Messages
 *
 * This example demonstrates how to use threading to group all workflow
 * notifications (start, complete, error) into a single thread.
 *
 * Threading helps reduce channel clutter by keeping related messages together.
 * Each workflow run creates a new thread automatically.
 *
 * Note: Threading only works with bot tokens, not webhooks.
